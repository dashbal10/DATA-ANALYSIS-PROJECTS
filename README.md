# OBJECTIVE :
To build an interactive dashboard that calculates important flight-related KPIs, provides insights into airline performance, and allows users to search for specific flight routes across countries and cities.

# DESCRIPTION :   
In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization dashboard using Power BI. The main objective was to analyze flight data and present it in a user-friendly format for stakeholders. The following key tasks were performed:

1. **Date Field Calculations:**
   - Created a composite Date field from individual Year, Month, and Day fields to derive the following time-based fields:
     - Year
     - Month Number
     - Full Month Name
     - Financial Month
     - Calendar and Financial Quarters
     - Year-Month (format: YYYY-MMM)
     - Weekday Number and Weekday Name
   
2. **Load Factor Percentage Calculations:**
   - Calculated the **Load Factor Percentage** (Transported passengers/Available seats) at different granularities:
     - **Yearly**
     - **Quarterly**
     - **Monthly**
   
3. **Carrier-Specific Load Factor Analysis:**
   - Computed Load Factor Percentage based on individual **Carrier Names** to understand airline performance.

4. **Top 10 Carriers Based on Passenger Preference:**
   - Identified the top 10 airlines based on passenger count and preferences.

5. **Top Flight Routes Based on Number of Flights:**
   - Displayed the busiest flight routes by counting the number of flights between origin and destination cities.

6. **Weekend vs Weekday Load Factor Comparison:**
   - Analyzed how the Load Factor differs on weekends versus weekdays.

7. **Flights Categorized by Distance Group:**
   - Segmented flights into distance-based groups to understand trends for short, medium, and long-haul flights.

8. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Built an **Analysis Dashboard** with visual representations of the calculated KPIs, including:
     - Load Factor Percentage Trends
     - Carrier Performance Charts
     - Flight Route Maps
   
9. **KPI Dashboard:**
   - Created a separate dashboard consolidating all calculated KPIs for quick access to critical metrics.

10. **Search Filter for Flight Routes:**
   - Integrated search filters to allow users to find flights based on:
     - Source Country, State, and City
     - Destination Country, State, and City

**Tools Used:**
- PowerBI
- Tableau,
- SQL and 
- Excel

**Key Takeaways:**
- Gained hands-on experience in data transformation, analysis, and visualization.
- Created an intuitive and interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.
- Developed an understanding of airline performance metrics and passenger preferences.

# PROJECT_002

# ROJECT TITLE: [Finance Dashboard For Superstore](https://github.com/dashbal10/DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECTS/blob/main/Finance%20Dashboard%20For%20Superstore.pbix)
![PROJECT_002](https://github.com/dashbal10/DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECTS/blob/main/SuperstoreDashboard.png)


**Project Overview**

This project leverages Power BI to create interactive data visualizations and dashboards for business analysis. The primary goal was to analyze datasets related to sales, finance, and profitability using a variety of visualizations and advanced features of Power BI, including DAX calculations, conditional formatting, and drillthroughs.

**Tools & Platforms**

    Power BI Desktop for building reports.
    Power BI Service for sharing and collaborating.
    DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and data modeling.

**Key Features**
1. **Sales Analysis: Year-over-Year Comparison**

    Visualization: Line and Clustered Chart
    Description: Used DAX to compare current year vs. last year sales and calculate growth percentages. This visualization provides insights into sales trends and growth over time.

2. **Data Modeling & Merging Multiple Data Sources**

    Data: 2023 Worldwide Box Office and past 3 years' data.
    Description: Imported data using Power Query Editor and created a master data table for further analysis, enabling a consolidated view of box office performance over multiple years.

3. **Category-wise Yearly Analysis**

    Visualization: Waterfall Chart
    Dataset: Superstore Dataset
    Description: A waterfall chart was built to break down sales data by category, helping stakeholders understand the financial contribution of each category year-over-year.

4. **Hierarchical Location-based Sales Visualization**

    Hierarchy: Location (Country > State > Region > City > Postal Code)
    Dataset: Superstore Dataset
    Description: Created a hierarchical structure to visualize sales performance at different geographic levels, enabling a drilldown from country to postal code.

5. **Interactive Finance Dashboard**

    Visualization: Clustered Column Chart
    Feature: Bookmarks
    Dataset: Finance Data
    Description: Developed an interactive dashboard with bookmarks based on the date (Year, Quarter, Month), allowing users to navigate seamlessly across different time periods.

6. **Profit Analysis with Drillthrough Feature**

    Visualization: Donut Chart
    Dataset: Superstore Dataset
    Description: Built a donut chart to visualize region-wise profit, with drillthrough functionality to explore detailed profit data for the West region.

7. **Conditional Formatting for Sales Metrics**

    Visualization: Table Visual
    Metrics: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount
    Dataset: Superstore Dataset
    Description: Applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics:
        Sales: Background color based on value.
        Profit: Green for positive values, Red for negative.
        Quantity: Data bars for easy comparison.
        Discount: Font color adjustment.

8. **Finance Dashboard with Navigation Cards and Slicers**

    Visualization: Finance Dashboard
    Features: Navigation Cards, Website Links, Slicers
    Dataset: Finance Dataset
    Description: Created a comprehensive finance dashboard that includes navigation cards, slicers for dynamic filtering, and external links for further exploration. This provides a single view of financial health.

**Conclusion**

The dashboard created in this project offers a dynamic and interactive way to visualize key business metrics, such as sales trends, load factor percentages, and profitability analysis. By using Power BI’s advanced features—such as drillthroughs, conditional formatting, and DAX calculations—the dashboard empowers users to dive deep into the data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

With its user-friendly design, the dashboard consolidates multiple KPIs into a single view, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the business. The inclusion of filters and navigation cards enhances the interactivity, enabling stakeholders to customize their views based on different time periods, regions, and other critical dimensions. Ultimately, this dashboard serves as a valuable tool for driving data-driven decision-making in real-time.
