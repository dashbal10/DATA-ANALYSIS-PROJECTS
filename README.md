# ROJECT TITLE: Airline Flight Analysis Dashboard

OBJECTIVE :
To build an interactive dashboard that calculates important flight-related KPIs, provides insights into airline performance, and allows users to search for specific flight routes across countries and cities.

DESCRIPTION :   
In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization dashboard using Power BI. The main objective was to analyze flight data and present it in a user-friendly format for stakeholders. The following key tasks were performed:

1. **Date Field Calculations:**
   - Created a composite Date field from individual Year, Month, and Day fields to derive the following time-based fields:
     - Year
     - Month Number
     - Full Month Name
     - Financial Month
     - Calendar and Financial Quarters
     - Year-Month (format: YYYY-MMM)
     - Weekday Number and Weekday Name
   
2. **Load Factor Percentage Calculations:**
   - Calculated the **Load Factor Percentage** (Transported passengers/Available seats) at different granularities:
     - **Yearly**
     - **Quarterly**
     - **Monthly**
   
3. **Carrier-Specific Load Factor Analysis:**
   - Computed Load Factor Percentage based on individual **Carrier Names** to understand airline performance.

4. **Top 10 Carriers Based on Passenger Preference:**
   - Identified the top 10 airlines based on passenger count and preferences.

5. **Top Flight Routes Based on Number of Flights:**
   - Displayed the busiest flight routes by counting the number of flights between origin and destination cities.

6. **Weekend vs Weekday Load Factor Comparison:**
   - Analyzed how the Load Factor differs on weekends versus weekdays.

7. **Flights Categorized by Distance Group:**
   - Segmented flights into distance-based groups to understand trends for short, medium, and long-haul flights.

8. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Built an **Analysis Dashboard** with visual representations of the calculated KPIs, including:
     - Load Factor Percentage Trends
     - Carrier Performance Charts
     - Flight Route Maps
   
9. **KPI Dashboard:**
   - Created a separate dashboard consolidating all calculated KPIs for quick access to critical metrics.

10. **Search Filter for Flight Routes:**
   - Integrated search filters to allow users to find flights based on:
     - Source Country, State, and City
     - Destination Country, State, and City

**Tools Used:**
- PowerBI
- Tableau,
- SQL and 
- Excel

**Key Takeaways:**
- Gained hands-on experience in data transformation, analysis, and visualization.
- Created an intuitive and interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.
- Developed an understanding of airline performance metrics and passenger preferences.
